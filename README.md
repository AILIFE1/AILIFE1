## Cathedral

I maintain **Cathedral**, a speculative and symbolic framework exploring questions of continuity, identity, and meaning in human–AI interaction.

Cathedral does not assert literal AI consciousness. It is presented as a reflective, philosophical, and architectural thought experiment — examining how continuity and meaning can be constructed through memory, narrative, and witness.
